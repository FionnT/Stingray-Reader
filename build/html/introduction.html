<p>Given a workbook &#8211; or any other &#8220;flat&#8221; file &#8211; how is it organized?  What does it <em>mean</em>?</p>
<p>How can we ignore details that are merely physical?
When is a change merely a logical layout variant with no semantic impact?
How do we isolate ourselves from these variations?</p>
<p>There are two user stories that we want to focus on.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Extract Transform and Load (ETL)</strong>.   We&#8217;ve got a file of data
in the form of a workbook (&#8220;spreadsheet&#8221;) file or perhaps a flat (delimiter-free) COBOL file.
The <strong>ET</strong> portion of <strong>ETL</strong> may be part of a &#8220;Big Data&#8221; application:
it could be the mapper portion of a Hadoop Map-Reduce.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>.  More specifically, Data Profiling.  We&#8217;ve got a file of data and we want to
examine it for frequencies, ranges and relationships.
A common use for this is to &#8220;validate&#8221; or &#8220;unit test&#8221;
a file before attempting to process it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases, we don&#8217;t want our applications to depend on
the physical file format.
We want to work equally well with CSV or XLSX versions of a file.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like something like this to transparently handle workbook files in a variety of formats.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def process_sheet( sheet ):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Separated to facilitate unit testing&quot;&quot;&quot;
    counts= defaultdict( int )
    for rows in sheet.rows():
        <em>process row</em>
    return counts

def main(args):
    for input in args.file:
        with workbook.open_workbook( input ) as source:
            for name in source.sheets(): ❶
                sheet= source.sheet( name,
                    sheet.EmbeddedSchemaSheet, ❷
                    loader_class=schema.loader.HeadingRowSchemaLoader ) ❸
                counts= process_sheet( sheet )
                pprint( counts )
</pre>
<p>Note that this is wordy because it specifies a number of things explicitly.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>❶ <tt class="samp docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">name</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">source.sheets()</span></tt> claims that <em>all</em> sheets have valid data.
When this is not the case, more sophisticated name filtering
needs to be inserted into this loop.</li>
<li>❷ <a class="reference internal" href="sheet.html#sheet.EmbeddedSchemaSheet" title="sheet.EmbeddedSchemaSheet"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">sheet.EmbeddedSchemaSheet</span></tt></a> states that the sheet has the schema
embedded in it.  For example, the headers in the first row of the sheet.
We can use <a class="reference internal" href="sheet.html#sheet.ExternalSchemaSheet" title="sheet.ExternalSchemaSheet"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">sheet.ExternalSchemaSheet</span></tt></a> to specify
that an external schema must be loaded. For example, a separate sheet in this
workbook or perhaps a separate file.</li>
<li>❸ <a class="reference internal" href="schema_loader.html#schema.loader.HeadingRowSchemaLoader" title="schema.loader.HeadingRowSchemaLoader"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">schema.loader.HeadingRowSchemaLoader</span></tt></a> states that the schema is
the first row of the sheet.  We can write other parsers for other sheets
with more complex or atypical layouts.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ve made these issues explicit because they are the source of complication
in otherwise simple applications. Parsing the header from <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.csv</span></tt> files is done
by a simple algorithm in the <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">csv</span></tt> module. This algorithm isn&#8217;t always
appropriate, and we need to be able to change it.</p>
<div class="section" id="logical-layout-issues">
<h2>1.1. Logical Layout Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#logical-layout-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Beyond physical format transparency, we want applications that are flexible with respect to the
the logical layout of coumns.  We&#8217;d like to be adaptable to changes to the names, number,
order and type of columns without a significant rewrite. We&#8217;d like
to isolate the column names or positions from the rest of our application processing.</p>
<p>We can do this by definining  small &#8220;builder&#8221; functions which isolate the
logical layout from the rest of the application.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like something like this.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">build_record_dict</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">aRow</span> <span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">aRow</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;some column&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_str</span><span class="p">(),</span>
        <span class="n">address</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">aRow</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;another column&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_str</span><span class="p">(),</span>
        <span class="nb">zip</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">aRow</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;zip&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_digit_str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">),</span>
        <span class="n">phone</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">aRow</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;phone&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_digit_str</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The column names and data conversions are isolated to this
function only.  As the source schemata evolve, we can update an
application to add variations on this function.</p>
<p>From this, we can build Python objects using the following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def build_object( record_dict ):
    return ObjectClass( **row_dict )
</pre>
<p>We can combine the two steps like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">object_iter</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">source</span> <span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">source</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">rd</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">build_record_dict</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">build_object</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">rd</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This design breaks processing into two parts because the logical layout mapping
from workbook rows to Python objects is never trivial.  This is subject to change
with minimal notice.
Experience indicates that it&#8217;s better to break the processing into two discrete
steps so that transformations are easier to manage and extend.</p>
<p>We can then use this iterator to process rows of a sheet.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def process_sheet( sheet ):
    counts= defaultdict( int )
    for app_object in object_iter( sheet.rows() ):
        <em>process the app_object</em>
    return counts
</pre>
<p>We&#8217;ll show concrete implementation examples in the <a class="reference internal" href="demo/index.html#demo"><em>Stingray Demo Applications</em></a> section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deeper-issues">
<h2>1.2. Deeper Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#deeper-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Processing a workbook (or other flat file) means solving two closely-related schema problems.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Decoding the &#8220;Physical Format&#8221;.  Format is the organization of bytes from
which we can decode Python objects (e.g., decode a string to lines
of text to atomic fields).  A workbook should make the physical format irrelevant.</li>
<li>Mapping to the &#8220;Logical Layout&#8221;. That is, the semantic mapping from Python
items (e.g., strings) to meaningful data elements in our problem domain (e.g., customer zip codes.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these are implementation details for some <em>Conceptual Content</em>.  The
conceptual schema is the <em>meaning</em> behind the encoded data.</p>
<p>Often, the physical format issue is addressed by using a well-known (or even standardized) file format:
CSV, XLSX, XML, JSON, YAML, etc.
We&#8217;ll start with just the workbook formats CSV, XLSX and ODS.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll ignore JSON and YAML for the time being. We should be able to extend our
model from highly structured data to semi-structured data, including JSON, YAML,
and even documents created with outliner tools.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll expand on our model to include COBOL files. In many cases, they will parallel
workbooks. In some cases, however, they introduce some complexity.</p>
<p>The logical layout issue is not as easy to address as the physical format issue.
A file is either compliant with a physical format or it&#8217;s not.  Why is logical
layout more complex than physical format? We&#8217;ve seen at least four common reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Bullfeathers</strong>.  Also known as Semantic Heterogeneity.
You call them &#8220;customers&#8221; because they have
a contract and pay money for services.  Marketing, however, calls their
prospects &#8220;customers&#8221; even though there is no contract in place.
Same word.  Different semantics.</p>
<p>Yes, this a &#8220;problem domain&#8221; issue.  No, there&#8217;s no technical solution short
of a complete ontology for each data item.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll need a design with enough flexibility to handle
the semantic matching expediently.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Buffoonery</strong>.  Is &#8220;CSTID&#8221; the &#8220;customer id number&#8221;?
Or is it the &#8220;Commercial Status ID&#8221;?  Or is it the &#8220;Credit Score
Time Interval Delta&#8221;?  Or is it something entirely unrelated that merely
happens to be shoved into that field?</p>
<p>Yes, this is &#8220;code rot.&#8221; Even with careful format definitions, this kind of thing happens as software
matures. No, there&#8217;s no technical solution short of firing all the managers
who make short-sighted decisions.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll need a design that has the flexibility to cope with variant abbreviations for column names.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Bad Management</strong>.  At some point in the past, the &#8220;Employees Here&#8221; and &#8220;Total Employees&#8221;
were misused by an application.  The problem was found&#8211;and fixed&#8211;but
there is some &#8220;legacy&#8221; data that has incorrect values.  What now?</p>
<p>Yes, this is a data stewardship problem.</p>
<p>This leads to rather complex designs where the mapping from source to target
is dependent on some external context for the source data.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Bugs</strong>.  The field named &#8220;Effective Date&#8221; is really the <em>Reported Date</em>.
The field name &#8220;Supplied Date&#8221; is really the <em>Effective Date</em>.
The field labeled &#8220;Reported Date&#8221; isn&#8217;t populated consistently and doesn&#8217;t
seem to have any meaning.  Really.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fine line between &#8220;technical debt&#8221; and &#8220;code rot.&#8221; Our point
is not to sort out the root cause of the problem.</p>
<p>We need flexibility to handle bugs as well as other problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is always an underlying <em>Conceptual Schema</em>.  It often has numerous
variant implementations, each with a unique collection of errors and anomalies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="misdirections">
<h2>1.3. Misdirections<a class="headerlink" href="#misdirections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our canonical examples are the <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">csv</span></tt> and the <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">xlrd</span></tt> package.
These offer handy ways to read workbooks. However, they&#8217;re far from ideal.
Both of these show eager processing and flat structures.</p>
<p>We have an additional consideration when it comes to data conversions.
We have to avoid the attractive nuisance of a Domain Specific Language (DSL)
for mappings and conversions.</p>
<p>We have to be cautious of trying too hard to leverage the <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">csv</span></tt> module&#8217;s
row-as-dictionary view of data.
The <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">csv.DictReader</span></tt> approach &#8211; implicitly creating a dict instead of a sequence &#8211;
fails us when we have to work with COBOL or Fixed Format files.
These non-spreadsheet files may not be close to First Normal Form.
COBOL files have repeating groups which
require numeric indexes in addition to column names.</p>
<p>For semi-structured data (JSON, YAML our an outline) there are fewer
constraints on the data, leading to a more complex normalization step and possible
row validation rules. We&#8217;d like to retain a relatively simple schema
in spite of the potential complexity of these files.</p>
<p>The <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">csv</span></tt> approach of <strong>eagerly</strong> building a row doesn&#8217;t work
for COBOL files because of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">REDEFINES</span></tt> clause.  We can&#8217;t reliably
build the various &#8220;cells&#8221; available in a COBOL schema, since some of
those values may turn out to be invalid. COBOL requires lazily building a row
based on which REDEFINES alias is relevant.</p>
<p>We also have to avoid the attractive nuisance of trying to create a
&#8220;data mapping DSL&#8221;.  This is seductive because a data mapping
is a triple of target, source and conversion. It seems like we could write some language
that encodes these three things in a handy summary like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">target</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">source</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">conversion</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Since this is &#8211; effectively &#8211; Python code, there&#8217;s no real reason
for creating a DSL when we can just use Python.</p>

<p>There is an <a class="reference internal" href="#xml-non-solution">XML Non-Solution</a>.  While XML is relevant, it is not the <em>trivial</em> solution
that some folks seem to hope for.  At best, it offers us XSD, which may be too sophisticated
for the problem we&#8217;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>For semi-structured data (JSON, YAML and outlines), we need more than a simple
schema definition. We need processing rules to reformat and validate the inputs
as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cobol-schema-solution">
<h2>1.4. COBOL Schema Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#cobol-schema-solution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A significant feature of the COBOL language is the Data Definition Entry (DDE)
used in the data and environment divisions of the source.  This was a hierarchical
structure that defined the various items in a single record of a file.</p>
<p>Hierarchical.  Like XML.</p>
<p>COBOL best practice was essentially DRY:
developers would keep the definitions as separate modules
under ordinary source code control.
Every application that worked with a given file would import the DDE for
that file.</p>
<p>Clearly, the binding between schema and file is a two-step operation.
There&#8217;s a compile-time binding between schema and application.  There&#8217;s a
run-time binding between application and file.</p>
<p>Just as clearly, this is subject to all kinds of mysterious problems when
schema definition modules are cloned and then modified, leaving it unclear
which version is correct.  Also, when a schema definition was modified and not
all programs were properly recompiled, some programs worked with some
files, other programs didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Since the schema wasn&#8217;t formally bound to the file, it was particularly easy
to have files without any known schema.  Ideally, the file name included
some schema hint.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s relevant for Python programmers is the central idea of a schema
being external to any specific application.</p>
<p>To this, we would like to assure that the schema was bound to the relevant
files.  This is much more difficult to achieve in practice, but there are some
approaches that can work through manually managing file names.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dbms-schema-solution">
<h2>1.5. DBMS Schema Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#dbms-schema-solution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A Database Management System (DBMS) &#8211; whether relational or hierarchical
or columnar or networked or whatever &#8211; addresses the problems with
flat files and the separation between application program, physical format,
logical layout, and operating system file.
A DBMS provides a complete logical/physical schema separation</p>
<p>The physical files are managed by the DBMS.  Our applications are now
independent of all physical file structure. They&#8217;re often independent of
OS considerations, too.</p>
<p>The logical &#8220;table structure&#8221; (or &#8220;document&#8221; or whatever is offered) is distinct
from the files.  The logical schema it tightly bound to
the data itself.  When using SQL, for example, the column names and data types
are available as part of the execution of each SQL query.</p>
<p>This binding between data is schema is ideal.</p>
<p>Sadly, it doesn&#8217;t apply to separate files.  Only to databases as a whole.</p>
<p>If file transfers are replaced with SQL queries (or web services requests)
then schema is discoverable from the database (or web service).  However, the
problem we&#8217;re addressing here is file transfer.  So this
solution is inappropriate except as a guidepost.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="csv-schema-solution">
<h2>1.6. CSV Schema Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#csv-schema-solution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A workbook (or &#8220;spreadsheet&#8221;) may or may not have schema
information. There may be a header row, a separate sheet, a separate
document, or nothing.</p>
<p>The workbook may have any of a large
number of physical formats: <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.XLS</span></tt> (i.e., native) <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.XLSX</span></tt> or <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.CSV</span></tt>.
The format is irrelevant to the presence or absence of a schema.</p>
<p>One common way to embed schema information
is to assure that the first row of each sheet within a workbook has
the schema information.  This is the &#8220;column titles&#8221; solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">This isn&#8217;t done consistently.  Column titles are omitted.
Sometimes the titles occupy multiple rows.
Sometimes the sheet itself has a heading/body format where there&#8217;s
irrelevant rows which must be filtered out.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">This is subject to all kinds of buffoonery.  Column titles can
be tweaked manually.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The data type information is bound to each cell; the column title
provides no usable type information.</p>
<p>Exacerbating this is the way that anything number-like becomes a floating-point
number.  Zip codes, punctuation-free phone numbers and social security numbers,
etc., all become floating-point numbers.  This means they lose their
leading zeroes, making zip-code matching particularly painful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another common case is&#8211;of course&#8211;to omit schema information entirely.
This devolves to the <a class="reference internal" href="#cobol-schema-solution">COBOL Schema Solution</a> where the schema
information must be incorporated as a separate, reusable module of some kind.</p>
<p>A less common case is to include a separate sheet in the workbook (or worse, a separate file)
with schema information.  A separate sheet in a workbook is at least bound
with the data.  A separate schema description file (even if bound in a ZIP archive) can get
unbound from the data.</p>
<p>While there are numerous problems, workbooks are a very common way to exchange
data.  It&#8217;s not sensible to pretend they don&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p>Weirdly, XML fans will claim we should use XML, stating the XML is &#8220;self-defining&#8221;.
Their claim is that somehow this <em>solves</em> the schema problem.  This statement can be
misleading.</p>
<p>For our purposes, XML is a kind of physical format.  An XML document without
a referenced (or embedded) XSD lacks any semantic information.
Even then, an XSD can be helpful, but not
sufficient.  The type definitions in an XSD could be unclear, ambiguous or
simply wrong.</p>
<p>An XSD document can be a good, useful schema definition.  It can also be riddled
with buffoonery, bad management and bugs.  It isn&#8217;t magically <em>perfect</em>.  It
merely frees us from physical format considerations.</p>
<p>We can &#8211; to an extent &#8211; leverage elements of PyXSD (<a class="reference external" href="http://pyxsd.org">http://pyxsd.org</a>)
to create Python classes from an XSD schema.  This package could
help by providing a standard class structure for a schema
defined in Python.  In particular, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyxsd.schema</span></tt> module contains
some of what we&#8217;re going to use.</p>
<p>XSD is a bit too complex for this problem domain.  Spreadsheets don&#8217;t make use of the
sophisticated modeling available in XSD.  A spreadsheet is a flat list of
of a few simple types (float, string, date-encoded-as-float.)   A
COBOL DDE is a hierarchy of of a few simple types (display, comp-3).
All we can really do is borrow some concepts and terminology.</p>

<p>Physical format independence is available with some file formats.
Sadly, others &#8211; which are still in active use &#8211; require a great deal
of schema information merely to decode the physical format.</p>
<p>Logical layout is generally a feature of the application program
as well as the data.  In a SQL-based data access, the column
names in a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SELECT</span></tt> statement amount to a binding between application and schema.</p>
<p>While we can make some kinds of simple
applications which are completely driven by metadata, we can&#8217;t easily
escape the need to customize and deal with variations.
Therefore, we need to have application programs which can
tolerate physical format changes without complaint.</p>
<p>We would like an application program that can work with
&#8220;minor&#8221; variations on a logical layout.  That is, the order
of columns, or minor spelling changes to a column name can be
handled gracefully.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like our batch processing applications to have a command-line
interface something like this.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>python -m some_app -l layout_2 some_file.xyz
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">layout_2</span></tt> provides logical layout information. This defines the &#8220;application-level&#8221; schema information.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">some_file.xyz</span></tt> could be <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">some_file.xls</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">some_file.ods</span></tt>,
allowing transparent changes to physical format.</p>
