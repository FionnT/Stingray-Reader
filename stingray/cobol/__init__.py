# COBOL Package -- Extend Schema to Handle EBCDIC
# #######################################################
#
# The COBOL package is a (large) Python ``__init__.py`` module which
# includes much of the public API for working with COBOL files.
#
# This module extends Stingray in several directions.
#
# -   A new :py:class:`schema.Attribute` subclass, :py:class:`cobol.RepeatingAttribute`.
#
# -   A handy :py:func:`cobol.dump` function.
#
# -   The hierarchy of classes based on :py:class:`cobol.COBOL_File` which provide
#     more sophisticated COBOL-based workbooks.
#    
# Within the package we have the :py:mod:`cobol.loader` module which parses DDE's
# to create a schema. 
#
# Module Overheads
# =================
#
# ..  py:module:: cobol
#
# We depend on :py:mod:`cell`, :py:mod:`schema`, and :py:mod:`workbook`.
# We'll also import one class definition from :py:mod:`cobol.defs`.

# RepeatingAttribute Subclass of Attribute
# =========================================
#
# A new :py:class:`schema.Attribute` subclass is required to carry all the 
# additional attribute information developed during COBOL DDE parsing.  
#
# An attribute that has an occurs clause (or who's parent has an occurs clause)
# can accept an :py:meth:`cobol.RepeatingAttribute.index` method to provide index values used to compute
# effective offsets.

#
# In order to fetch data for ODO, the attribute offsets and sizes
# cannot **all** be computed in advance during parsing.
#
# They must be computed lazily during data fetching. See the :py:class:`ODO_LazyRow` 
# definition for how the attributes sizes and offsets are computed lazily 
# when there's an Occurs Depending On.
#
# Here are the attributes inherited from :py:class:`schema.Attribute`.
#
# :name: 
#     The attribute name. Typically always available for most kinds of schema.
#    
# :create: Cell class to create.  If omitted, the class-level
#     :py:data:`Attribute.default_cell` will be used.
#     By default, this refers to :py:class:`cell.TextCell`.
#    
# :position: 
#     Optional sequential position. This is set by the :py:class:`schema.Schema`
#     that contains this object.
#
# The additional values commonly provided by simple fixed format file schemata.
# These can't be treated as simple values, however, since they're
# clearly changed based on the ODO issues.
#   
# :size: 
#     Size within the buffer.
#
# These two properties can be tweaked by the :py:meth:`index` method. If left alone, they simply
# a delegation to the DDE. If :py:meth:`index` is used, these may be modified based on the index arguments.
#
# :dimensionality:
#     A tuple of DDE's that defines the dimensionality pushed down to this
#     item through the COBOL DDE hierarchy.
#
# :offset: 
#     Optional offset into a buffer. This may be statically defined,
#     or it may be dynamic because of variably-located data supporting
#     the Occurs Depends On.
#    
#     This meay be tweaked by the :py:meth:`index` method.
#     
# This subclass introduces yet more attribute-like properties that simply
# delegate to the DDE.
#
# :dde:
#     A weakref to a :py:class:`cobol.loader.DDE` object.
#
# :path:
#     The "."-separated path from top-level name to this element's name.
#    
# :usage:
#     The original DDE.usage object, an instance of :py:class:`cobol.defs.Usage`
#    
# :redefines:
#     The original DDE.allocation object, an instance of :py:class:`cobol.loader.Allocation`
#    
# :picture:
#     The original DDE.picture object, an instance of :py:class:`cobol.defs.Picture`
#    
# :size_scale_precision:
#     The original DDE.sizeScalePrecision object, a tuple with size, scale and precision derived
#     from the picture.

# COBOL "Workbook" Files
# ========================
#
# A COBOL file is -- in effect -- a single-sheet workbook with an external schema.
# It looks, then, a lot like :py:class:`workbook.Fixed_Workbook`.  
#
# -   A pure character file, encoded UNICODE characters in some standard encoding
#     like UTF-8 or UTF-16.  This cannot include COMP or COMP-3 fields because
#     the codec would make a mess of the bit patterns.
#
# -   An EBCDIC-encoded byte file.  This can include COMP or COMP-3 fields.
#
# -   An ASCII-encoded byte file.  This can include COMP or COMP-3 fields.  
#     While this may exist, it seems to be very rare. We don't implement it.
#
# Note that each cell creation involves two features. This leads to a kind of **Double Dispatch** algorithm.  
#
# -   The cell type.  :py:class:`cobol.defs.TextCell`, 
#     :py:class:`cobol.defs.NumberDisplayCell`, 
#     :py:class:`cobol.defs.NumberComp3Cell` or :py:class:`cobol.defs.NumberCompCell`.
#
# -   The workbook encoding type.  Character or EBCDIC (or ASCII).
#
# The issue here is we're stuck with a complex "double-dispatch" problem.
# Each workbook subclass needs to implement methods for ``get_text``, ``number_display``,
# ``number_comp`` and ``number_comp3``.  
#
# The conversions, while tied to the workbook encoding, aren't properly tied to
# stateful sheet and row processing in the workbook.  They're just bound to the 
# encoding.  Consequently, we can make them static methods, possibly even 
# making this a mixin strategy.
#
# The use case looks like this.
#
# 1.  The application uses ``row.cell( schema[n] )``.  
#     The ``cell()`` method is simply ``sheet.workbook.row_get( buffer, attribute )``.  
#     It applies the cell type (via the schema item's attribute) and the raw data in the row's buffer.
#
# 2.  ``row_get( buffer, attribute )`` has to do the following.
#
#     -   Convert the buffer into a proper value based on the ``attribute`` type
#         information **and** the worksheet-specific methods for unpacking the 
#         various types of data.  The various :py:mod:`cobol` Cell subclasses
#         can refer to the proper conversion methods.
#    
#     -   Create the required :py:class:`cell.Cell` based on the ``attribute.create(sheet, value)`` function.
