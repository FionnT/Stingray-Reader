#     a custom format consisting of a Protobuf stream wrapped in a Snappy stream.
#
#     "Snappy Compression
#
#     "Snappy is a compression format created by Google aimed at providing decent 
#     compression ratios at high speeds. IWA files are stored in Snappy's framing format,
#     though they do not adhere rigorously to the spec. 
#     In particular, they do not include the required Stream Identifier chunk, 
#     and compressed chunks do not include a CRC-32C checksum.
#
#     "The stream is composed of contiguous chunks prefixed by a 4 byte header. 
#     The first byte indicates the chunk type, which in practice is always 0 for iWork, 
#     indicating a Snappy compressed chunk. 
#     The next three bytes are interpreted as a 24-bit little-endian integer 
#     indicating the length of the chunk. 
#     The 4 byte header is not included in the chunk length.

# The snappy protocol has two levels. 
#
# -   The LZ77 decoder which expands the tags to create the data.
#     There are four kinds of tags.
#    
#     -   0b00: literal
#    
#                     Literals are uncompressed data stored directly in the byte stream.
#                     The literal length is stored differently depending on the length
#                     of the literal:
#
#                     -  For literals up to and including 60 bytes in length, the upper
#                        six bits of the tag byte contain (len-1). The literal follows
#                        immediately thereafter in the bytestream.
#               
#                     -  For longer literals, the (len-1) value is stored after the tag byte,
#                        little-endian. The upper six bits of the tag byte describe how
#                        many bytes are used for the length; 60, 61, 62 or 63 for
#                        1-4 bytes, respectively. The literal itself follows after the
#                        length.
#                       
#     -   0b01: Copy with 1-byte offset
#
#                         These elements can encode lengths between [4..11] bytes and offsets
#                         between [0..2047] bytes. (len-4) occupies three bits and is stored
#                         in bits [2..4] of the tag byte. The offset occupies 11 bits, of which the
#                         upper three are stored in the upper three bits ([5..7]) of the tag byte,
#                         and the lower eight are stored in a byte following the tag byte.
#                        
#     -   0b10: Copy with a 2-byte offset
#    
#                         These elements can encode lengths between [1..64] and offsets from
#                         [0..65535]. (len-1) occupies six bits and is stored in the upper
#                         six bits ([2..7]) of the tag byte. The offset is stored as a
#                         little-endian 16-bit integer in the two bytes following the tag byte.
#
#     -   0b11: Copy with a 4-byte offset
#    
#                         These are like the copies with 2-byte offsets (see previous subsection),
#                         except that the offset is stored as a 32-bit integer instead of a
#                         16-bit integer (and thus will occupy four bytes).
