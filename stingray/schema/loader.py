# Schema Loader Module -- Load Embedded or External Schema
# #####################################################################
#
# ..  py:module:: schema.loader
#
# A *Schema Loader* loads the attributes of a schema from a source document.
# There are a variety of sources.
#
# -   The first row of a sheet within a workbook.  
#     This version has to be injected into workbook processing
#     so that the first row is separated from the data rows.
#
# -   A separate sheet of a workbook.
#     This version requires a sheet name.
#        
# -   A separate workbook.  This, too, requires a named sheet.
#
# -   COBOL Code.  We'll set this aside as a subclass
#     so complex it requires it's own module.
#
# A schema loader is paired with a specific kind of :py:class:`sheet.Sheet`.
#
# A workbook requires a schema, which requires a schema loader.
# A schema loader depends on a meta-workbook.  Ideally that meta-workbook has
# an emedded schema, but it may have an external schema, meaning we could have a 
# meta-schema required load the schema for the application data.  Sheesh.
#
# First, let's hope that doesn't happen.  Second, the circularity is resolved by making it the responsibility of the
# the application to handle schema loading.
#
# Embedded Schema Use Case
# ===============================
#
# A :py:class:`sheet.EmbeddedSchemaSheet` requires a loader class.
# The loader will 
#
# 1.  Be built with the sheet as an argument.
#
# 2.  Be interrogated for the schema.
#
# 3.  Be interrogated for the rows.
#
# The most typical case is the single-header-row case.  
#
# In some cases, the loader is actually a
# a rather sophisticated parser that paritions the data into the embedded schema 
# and the data rows.
#
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#     with Workbook( name ) as wb:
#         sheet = self.wb.sheet( 'Sheet2', 
#             stingray.sheet.EmbeddedSchemaSheet,
#             loader_class= stingray.schema.loader.HeadingRowSchemaLoader )
#            
#         for row in sheet.rows():
#             *process the row*
#
# External Schema Use Case
# ===============================
#
# A :py:class:`sheet.ExternalSchemaSheet` requires a schema.
#
# In the typical case, the external schema file has an emedded meta-schema.
# The first row has appropriate column names.
# This requires a subclass of :py:class:`schema.loader.ExternalSchemaLoader` to properly map the names that were found onto the attributes of the :py:class:`schema.Attribute` class.
#
# When the embedded meta-schema has unusual names, then a builder must be defined
# to map the names that are found in the schema and build an :py:class:`schema.Attribute` instance.
#
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#     with open_workbook( schema_name ) as schema_wb:
#         esl= stingray.schema.loader.ExternalSchemaLoader( schema_wb, "Schema" )
#         schema= esl.schema()
#     with Workbook( name, schema=schema ) as wb:
#         sheet = self.wb.sheet( 'Sheet2', 
#             stingray.sheet.ExternalSchemaSheet,
#             schema= schema )
#         counts= process_sheet( sheet )
#         pprint.pprint( counts )
#
# Manual Schema Use Case
# ===============================
#
# Also, a manually-defined :py:class:`schema.Schema` can be built rather than being loaded.
#
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#     schema= stingray.schema.Schema( 
#         stingray.schema.Attribute( name='Column #1' ),
#         stingray.schema.Attribute( name='Key' ),
#         stingray.schema.Attribute( name='Value' ),
#         stingray.schema.Attribute( name='Etc.' ),
#     )

# External Schema Loader
# ==========================
#
# ..  py:class:: ExternalSchemaLoader
#
#     In some cases, the data workbook is described by a separate schema workbook, or a separate
#     sheet within the data workbook.  In these cases, the other sheet (or file) must be
#     parsed to locate schema information.
#
#     In the case of a fixed format file, we must examine a separate
#     file to load schema information.  This additional schems file may be in 
#     COBOL notation, leading to a more complex parser.  See :ref:`cobol_loader`. 
#
#     The layout of the schema, of course, will be highly variable, 
#     so the "meta-schema" must be adjusted to the actual file.
#
#     Note, also, that the schema loader is -- itself -- a typical of schema-based reader.  It has a number of common features.
#
#     1.  A dictionary-based "builder", :py:meth:`schema.loader.ExternalSchemaLoader.build_attr`, to handle Logical Layout.  
#         This transforms the input "raw" dictionary of :py:class:`cell.Cell` instances to an application dictionary of proper Python objects.
#         See :ref:`developer`.
#    
#     2.  An iterator, :py:meth:`schema.loader.ExternalSchemaLoader.attr_dict_iter`, 
#         that provides "raw" dictionaries from each row (based on the schema) to the 
#         builder to create application dictionaries.
#
#     3.  The overall function,
#         :py:meth:`schema.loader.ExternalSchemaLoader.schema`,
#         that iterates over application objects built from application dictionaries.
#
#     ..  py:attribute:: workbook
#    
#         The overall Workbook that we're parsing to locate schema information.
#    
#     ..  py:attribute:: Sheet
#    
#         A specific sheet within that workbook.
#
# ::

class ExternalSchemaLoader( SchemaLoader ):
    """Open a workbook file in a well-known format.  
    Build a schema with attribute name, offset, size  and type
