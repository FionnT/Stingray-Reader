The TODO List
===============

Look at https://github.com/slott56/DataSynthTool.

The **Data Synth Tool** uses schema information to define ranges of values, and distributions.

Further, the **Data Synth Tool** emphasizes Pydantic's style of embedded data validation into the class definition.
While this adds a dependency, it seems like a useful direction.
