# =================

# Workbook Subclasses
# =====================
#
# We have a number of concrete subclasses of :py:class:`workbook.base.Workbook`. 
# These are imported from submodules and made visible in this module.
#
# -   :py:class:`workbook.CSV_Workbook`.  This is a degenerate case, where the workbook appears to contain
#     a single sheet.  This sheet is the CSV file, accessed via the built-in
#     :py:func:`csv.reader`.
#
# -   :py:class:`workbook.XLS_Workbook`.  This is the workbook as processed by :py:mod:`xlrd`.  These classes
#     wrap :py:mod:`xlrd` classes to which the real work is delegated.
#     This is optional -- if :py:mod:`xlrd` is not installed, things will work,
#     but these files cannot be opened.
#
# -   :py:class:`workbook.XLSX_Workbook`.  This is the workbook after unzipping and using an XML parser
#     on the various document parts.  Mostly, this is a matter of unzipping
#     and parsing parts of the document to create a DOM which can be traversed
#     as needed.
#
# -   :py:class:`workbook.Numbers09_Workbook`.
#     This handles the iWork '09 Numbers files with multiple 
#     workspaces and multiple tables in each workspace. 
#
# -   :py:class:`workbook.Numbers13_Workbook`
#     These handle the iWork '13 Numbers files with multiple 
#     workspaces and multiple tables in each workspace. 
#   
# -   :py:class:`workbook.ODS_Workbook`.
#
# -   :py:class:`workbook.Fixed_Workbook`.  This is actually a fairly complex case.  The workbook will appear to
#     contain a single sheet; this sheet is the fixed format file.  Schema information
#     was required up front, unlike the other formats.
#
# Further extensions will handle various kinds of COBOL files. They're similar to Fixed Workbooks.
# See :ref:`cobol`.
#
# Each of these is a context manager, so we include the necessary methods.
#
# Note that workbooks are rarely simple files.  Sometimes they are ZIP archive
# members.  Sometimes, they must be processed via **gzip**. Sometimes they involve
# Snappy compression.
#
# In order to minimize the assumptions, we try to handle two forms of file processing:
#
# -   By name. In this case, the file name is provided. The file is opened and closed by
#     the Workbook using the context manager interface.
#
# -   By file-like object. An open file-like object is provided. No additional
#     context management is performed. This is appropriate when a workbook is itself
#     a member of a larger archive.
#
#
# Workbook Factory
# =================
#
# This is the factory which creates a subclass of :class:`Workbook` for a 
# a given file. 
#
# ..  py:class:: Opener
#
#     An opener **Factory** class.  A subclass can extend this to handle other file
#     extensions and physical formats.
