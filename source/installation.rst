Installation via ``setup.py``
##############################

Use the following link to get the latest code:

    ``git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/stingrayreader/code stingrayreader-code``
    
It's also possible to get an archive distribution kit. These may be 
slightly out of date.

Optional Build-from-Scratch
=============================

The Stingray distribution kit (minimally) is just the following.

-   :file:`source`.  The RST-formatted source used by PyLit3 to 
    to create code and documentation.

-   :file:`sample`.  Several sample workbooks used for testing.

-   :file:`build.py`.  The build procedure.  

Given these two directories, the build procedure uses PyLit3 to create ``stingray`` package.  
It uses Sphinx to create the documentation.

See :ref:`build` for more information on the build procedure.  
This is an optional step to recreate the Python code from the documentation.

The build process required PyLit3 and Sphinx to be installed.
Setuptools can be used to simplify installation.

-   PyLit.  https://github.com/slott56/PyLit-3

-   Sphinx.  http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

-   Setuptools.  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

..  code-block:: bash

    python3 build.py
    
Installation via Distutils
=============================
    
To install ``stingray`` you can use the following.
On Linux, this may require privileges via ``sudo``.

..  code-block:: bash

    sudo python3 setup.py install
    
In some cases, you might want to break this down into a build step that
doesn't require privileges and the final install step, which does require
privileges.

..	code-block:: bash
	
	python3 setup.py build
	sudo python3 setup.py install

The ``setup.py`` File
======================

To use Stingray, you must have the following package installed.

-   xlrd.  http://www.lexicon.net/sjmachin/xlrd.htm

    Version 0.9.2 is Python 3 compatible. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd/0.9.2

This provides Python package information.

::

    from setuptools import setup
    import sys
    
    if sys.version_info < (3,3):
        print( "Stringray requires Python 3.3" )
        sys.exit(2)
    
    setup(
        name='stingray',
        version='4.4.4',
        description='Schema-Based File Reader, COBOL, EBCDIC Conversion, ETL, Data Profiling',
        author='S.Lott',
        author_email='s_lott@yahoo.com',
        url='https://sourceforge.net/projects/stingray/',
        packages=[
            'stingray', 
            'stingray.schema',
            'stingray.cobol',
            'stingray.workbook',
            ],
        package_data={'stingray': ['*.json']},

We depend on the release of Python itself, based on the ``sys.version_info`` named tuple.
We have a few Python3.3 features.

We depend XLRD, which comes from PyPi. This is required for normal use and operation.

For a full build from the source document, we depend on having a new release
of Sphinx and PyLit3.

The ``obsoletes`` is there in case anyone did happen to download the previous release.

        obsoletes=["cobol_dde","data_profile"],
