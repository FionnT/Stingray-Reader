COBOL Package -- Extend Schema to Handle EBCDIC
#######################################################

The COBOL package is a (large) Python ``__init__.py`` module which
includes much of the public API for working with COBOL files.

This module extends Stingray in several directions.

-   A new :py:class:`schema.Attribute` subclass, :py:class:`cobol.RepeatingAttribute`.

-   A handy :py:func:`cobol.dump` function.

-   The hierarchy of classes based on :py:class:`cobol.COBOL_File` which provide
    more sophisticated COBOL-based workbooks.
    
Within the package we have the :py:mod:`cobol.loader` module which parses DDE's
to create a schema. 

Module Overheads
=================

..  py:module:: cobol

We depend on :py:mod:`cell`, :py:mod:`schema`, and :py:mod:`workbook`.
We'll also import one class definition from :py:mod:`cobol.defs`.

RepeatingAttribute Subclasses of Attribute
===========================================

Two new :py:class:`schema.Attribute` subclasses are required to carry all the 
additional attribute information developed during COBOL DDE parsing.  

An attribute that has an ``OCCURS`` clause (or who's parent has an ``OCCURS`` clause)
can accept an :py:meth:`cobol.RepeatingAttribute.index` method to provide index values used to compute
effective offsets.

There are two variants.

-   The initial, immutable, :py:class:`cobol.RepeatingAttribute` as parsed.

-   A working :py:class:`cobol.IndexedAttribute`. This is a subclass of 
    :py:class:`cobol.RepeatingAttribute` and it contains partial or complete
    indexing. Partial indexing means that a tuple is built by 
    :py:meth:`cobol.COBOL_File.row_get`. Full indexing means that a single
    ``Cell`` can be built.

    [Fixed_Workbook]^[COBOL_File],
    [COBOL_File]-uses->[RepeatingAttribute].

..  image:: cobol_attribute.png

In order to fetch data for an ODO ``OCCURS`` element, the attribute offsets and sizes
cannot **all** be computed during parsing. 
They must be computed lazily during data fetching. The :py:class:`cobol.ODO_LazyRow` 
class handles the Occurs Depending On situation.

Here are the attributes inherited from :py:class:`schema.Attribute`.

:name: 
    The attribute name. Typically always available for most kinds of schema.
    
:create: Cell class to create.  If omitted, the class-level
    :py:data:`Attribute.default_cell` will be used.
    By default, this refers to :py:class:`cell.TextCell`.
    
:position: 
    Optional sequential position. This is set by the :py:class:`schema.Schema`
    that contains this object.

The additional values commonly provided by simple fixed format file schemata.
These can't be treated as simple values, however, since they're
clearly changed based on the ODO issues.
   
:size: 
    Size within the buffer.

These two properties over overridden by the :py:class:`cobol.IndexedAttribute` subclass;
this is created by the :py:meth:`cobol.RepeatingAttribute.index` method. 
The superclass versions are simple a delegation to the DDE. 
If :py:meth:`cobol.RepeatingAttribute.index` is used, the subclass object is built
where these values come from the ``index`` method results.

:dimensionality:
    A tuple of DDE's that defines the dimensionality pushed down to this
    item through the COBOL DDE hierarchy.

    This meay be set by the :py:meth:`cobol.RepeatingAttribute.index` method.

:offset: 
    Optional offset into a buffer. This may be statically defined,
    or it may be dynamic because of variably-located data supporting
    the Occurs Depends On.
    
    This meay be set by the :py:meth:`cobol.RepeatingAttribute.index` method.
     
This subclass introduces yet more attribute-like properties that simply
delegate to the DDE.

:dde:
    A weakref to a :py:class:`cobol.loader.DDE` object.

:path:
    The "."-separated path from top-level name to this element's name.
    
:usage:
    The original DDE.usage object, an instance of :py:class:`cobol.defs.Usage`
    
:redefines:
    The original DDE.allocation object, an instance of :py:class:`cobol.loader.Allocation`
    
:picture:
    The original DDE.picture object, an instance of :py:class:`cobol.defs.Picture`
    
:size_scale_precision:
    The original DDE.sizeScalePrecision object, a tuple with size, scale and precision derived
    from the picture.

..  py:method:: RepeatingAttribute.index( *values )

If the number of index values matches the dimensionality, we'll return a tweaked
attribute which has just the offset required and a dimensionality of ``tuple()``.

If the number of index values is insufficient, we'll return a tweaked attribute
with which has the starting offset and the dimensions left otherwise unspecified.

If the number of index values is excessive, we'll attempt to pop from an empty
list.

Note that :py:meth:`cobol.RepeatingAttribute.index` is applied incrementally when the application supplies some
of the indices.

-   First, an application can supply some of the indices, creating
    :py:class:`cobol.IndexedAttribute` with an initial offset.

-   Second, the :py:class:`COBOL_File` will supply any remaining indices,
    creating yet more temporary  :py:class:`cobol.IndexedAttribute` based on the initial offset.

With this, a ``row.cell(schema.get('name').index(i))`` will compute a proper offset.

We "clone" the attribute to assure that each time we apply (or don't apply)
the index, nothing stateful will have happened to the original immutable attribute
definition. 

Note that an incomplete set of index values forces the underlying 
workbook to create a Python tuple (or tuple of tuples) structure to
contain all the requested values. See :py:meth:`cobol.COBOL_File.row_get`.

sizes and offsets for COBOL.

Dump a Record
===============

..  py:function:: dump_iter

To support dumping raw data from a record, this will iterate through all items
in an original DDE. It will a five-tuple with (dde, attribute, indices, bytes, Cell)
for each DDE.

If the DDE does not have an OCCURS clause, the indices will be an empty tuple.
Otherwise, each individual combination will be yielded. For big, nested tables, this
may turn out to be a lot of combinations.

The bytes is the raw bytes for non-FILLER and non-group elements. 

The Cell will be a Cell object, either with valid data or an :py:class:`cobol.defs.ErrorCell`.

COBOL "Workbook" Files
========================

A COBOL file is -- in effect -- a single-sheet workbook with an external schema.
It looks, then, a lot like :py:class:`workbook.Fixed_Workbook`.  

-   A pure character file, encoded UNICODE characters in some standard encoding
    like UTF-8 or UTF-16.  This cannot include COMP or COMP-3 fields because
    the codec would make a mess of the bit patterns.

-   An EBCDIC-encoded byte file.  This can include COMP or COMP-3 fields.

-   An ASCII-encoded byte file.  This can include COMP or COMP-3 fields.  
    While this may exist, it seems to be very rare. We don't implement it.

Note that each cell creation involves two features. This leads to a kind of **Double Dispatch** algorithm.  

-   The cell type.  :py:class:`cobol.defs.TextCell`, 
    :py:class:`cobol.defs.NumberDisplayCell`, 
    :py:class:`cobol.defs.NumberComp3Cell` or :py:class:`cobol.defs.NumberCompCell`.

-   The workbook encoding type.  Character or EBCDIC (or ASCII).

The issue here is we're stuck with a complex "double-dispatch" problem.
Each workbook subclass needs to implement methods for ``get_text``, ``number_display``,
``number_comp`` and ``number_comp3``.  

The conversions, while tied to the workbook encoding, aren't properly tied to
stateful sheet and row processing in the workbook.  They're just bound to the 
encoding.  Consequently, we can make them static methods, possibly even 
making this a mixin strategy.

The common use case looks like this.

1.  The application uses ``row.cell( schema[n] )`` to fetch a :py:class:`cell.Cell`.
    The :py:meth:`cobol.ODO_LazyRow.cell` method is simply ``sheet.workbook.row_get( buffer, attribute )``.  
    It applies the cell type (via the schema item's attribute) and the raw data in the row's buffer.

2.  The workbook ``row_get( buffer, attribute )`` has to do the following.

    -   Convert the buffer into a proper value based on the ``attribute`` type
        information **and** the worksheet-specific methods for unpacking the 
        various types of data.  The various :py:mod:`cobol` Cell subclasses
        can refer to the proper conversion methods.
    
    -   Create the required :py:class:`cell.Cell` based on the ``attribute.create(sheet, value)`` function.
    
There's a less common use case to extract a subset of row bytes to populate a 
separate 01-level definition that's not tied to the Workbook's schema.

1.  The application uses ``subrow= row.data( schema[n], other_schema )`` to fetch some bytes that can
    be used to create a new LazyRow tied to a different schema.

2.  The application uses ``subrow.cell( subschema[m] )`` to fetch a :py:class:`cell.Cell`.
    This doesn't go back to the original workbook, it goes to this "subrow" of the
    workbook.

a schema attribute with dimensionality.

        row_class= ODO_LazyRow

..  py:method:: COBOL_File.row_get_index( row, attr, *index )

Returning a particular Cell from a row, however, is more interesting for COBOL
because the Attribute may contains an "OCCURS" clause.  In which case, we may need
to assemble a tuple of values.

If there is dimensionality, then take the top-level dimension (``dim[0]``) and
use it as an iterator to fetch data based on the rest of the dimensions (``dim[1:]``).

This can assemble a recursive tuple-of-tuples if there are multiple levels
of dimensionality. 

If too few index values are provided, a tuple of results is built around the missing values.

If enough values are provided, a single result object will be built.

    This is the most-used method. Removing the if-statement would be
    a huge improvement.

Note that this depends on the superclass, which depends ordinary Unicode/ASCII line breaks.
This will not work for EBCDIC files, which may lack appropriate line break characters.
For that, we'll need to use specific physical format parsing helpers based on the 
Z/OS RECFM parameter used to define the file.

We can use ``wb.subrow(subschema, row.cell(schema_header_dict['GENERIC-FIELD']))``
to map a particular field ('GENERIC-FIELD') to an entire 01-level schema, creating
a "subrow" from a single field within the parent row.

Character File
-----------------

This is subclass of :py:class:`COBOL_File` that handles COBOL data parsing
where the underlying file is text. Since the file is text, Python handles
any OS-level bytes-to-text conversions.

..  py:class:: Character_File

::

    class Character_File( COBOL_File ):
        """A COBOL "workbook" file with decoding functions for
        proper character data.
        """

The following functions are used to do data conversions for COBOL Character files.  
Text is easy, Python's ``io.open`` has already handled this.

::

        @staticmethod
        def text( buffer, attr ): 
            """Extract a text field's value."""
            return buffer 

Numeric data with usage ``DISPLAY`` requires handling implicit decimal points.

        def number_display( buffer, attr ):
            """Extract a numeric field's value."""

COMP-3 in proper character files may not make any sense at all.  
A codec would make a hash of the bit patterns required.  
However, we've defined the method here so that it can be used by the EBCDIC subclass
trivially.

We're going to build an ASCII version of the number by decoding the bytes into
a mutable bytearray and decorating them with decimal point and sign. This is 
demonstrably faster and avoids object creation to the extent possible.

COMP in proper character files may not make any sense, either.

Gagin, we've defined it here because that's relatively simple to extend.

We're simply going to unpack big-ending bytes.

EBCDIC File
---------------

The EBCDIC files require specific physical "Record Format" (RECFM) assistance.
These classes define a number of Z/OS RECFM conversion. We recognize four
actual RECFM's plus an additional special case.

-   F - Fixed.

-   FB - Fixed Blocked.

-   V - Variable, data must have the RDW word preserved.

-   VB - Variable Blocked, data must have BDW and RDW words.

-   N - Variable, but no BDW or RDW words. This involves some buffer management
    magic to recover the records properly.

Note: "IBM z/Architecture mainframes are all big-endian".

We must extend the :py:meth:`workbook.Character_File.rows_of` method to deal with 
two issues:

-   If the schema depends on a variably located DDE, then we need to do the 
    :py:func:`cobol.defs.setSizeAndOffset` function using the DDE.
    This is done automagically by the :py:class:`cobol.ODO_LazyRow` object.
    
-   The legacy Z/OS RECFM details. 

    *   We might have F or FB files, which are simply
        long runs of EBCDIC bytes with no line breaks.
        The LRECL must match the DDE.
        
    *   We might have V (or VB) which have 4-byte header on each row (plus a 4-byte header on each block.)
        The LRECL doesn't matter.
        
    *   We can tolerate the awful situation where it's variable length (Occurs Depending On)
        but there are no RECFM=V or RECFM=VB header words. We call this RECFM=N.
        We fetch an oversized buffer and push back bytes beyond the end of the record.
    
    This means that the ``super().rows_of( sheet )`` has been replaced with a RECFM-aware
    byte-parser. This byte parser may involve a back-and-forth to handle RECFM=N.
    In the case of RECFM=N, we provide an overly-large buffer (32768 bytes) and after
    any size and offset calculations, the ``row._size`` shows how many bytes were
    actually used.

We could define a subclass for files encoded in ASCII which contain COMP and COMP-3 values.

This is left as a future extension.
